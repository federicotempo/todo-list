todo-list

The Todo App started as a simple project to manage tasks, displaying them as visually organized bars with details like title, description, due date, and priority. Over time, it evolved with structured code using object constructors, making task creation reusable and scalable.

A date formatting library was added to ensure user-friendly and consistent date presentation. To enhance functionality, the app uses localStorage to save tasks persistently, allowing users to keep their changes even after refreshing or closing the browser.

The app also features a dynamic task counter and basic error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app combines core web development practices with practical features, creating a robust foundation for task management.
