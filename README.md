todo-list

The Todo App is a task management tool designed to be both functional and visually organized. Tasks are displayed as bars containing key details such as title, description, due date, and priority. The app is built using object constructors, making task creation reusable and scalable.

To enhance usability, it includes a date formatting library for consistent and user-friendly date display. It also uses localStorage to save tasks persistently, allowing users to retain their changes even after refreshing or closing the browser.

The app is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, a collapsible sidebar is introduced for improved navigation and usability. Additional features like a dynamic task counter and basic error handling ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app showcases a blend of responsive design, core functionality, and practical web development techniques.
